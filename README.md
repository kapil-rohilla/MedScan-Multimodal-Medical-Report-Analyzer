# MedScan – Multimodal Medical Report Analyzer

MedScan is an end‑to‑end AI system that reads medical PDFs, extracts text, tables, and images, classifies X‑ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, ECG and Non‑medical images, parses Indian lab reports such as CBC and Widal, and produces structured JSON plus LLM‑based Patient and Clinical summaries.
This project is intended for educational purposes only. It must not be used for real clinical decision‑making right now.
